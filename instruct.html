        <h1>Password Generation Instructions</h1>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>1. Avoid using personal information such as birthdates or names.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Using personal information in your password makes it easier for attackers to guess. Birthdates and names are often the first things hackers try when attempting to break into an account.</p>
            <p>Attackers can use information from social media or other public sources to guess passwords. Avoiding personal details reduces the risk of such attacks.</p>
            <p>Consider using a random string of characters instead of familiar information. This makes your password much harder to crack.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>2. The password should be at least 12 characters long for better security.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Longer passwords are generally more secure because they are harder to crack. Aim for a minimum of 12 characters to enhance security.</p>
            <p>Increasing the length of your password exponentially increases the number of possible combinations, making brute-force attacks more difficult.</p>
            <p>A longer password also helps defend against dictionary attacks, where attackers try common words and phrases.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>3. Include at least three special characters, such as !, @, #, $.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Special characters add complexity to your password, making it harder for attackers to guess. Mixing in symbols makes your password more robust.</p>
            <p>Characters like !, @, #, and $ increase the range of possible characters in your password, complicating attempts to crack it.</p>
            <p>Avoid using predictable special characters. Instead, use a variety of symbols to make your password more secure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>4. Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Using both uppercase and lowercase letters increases the number of possible combinations, thereby strengthening your password.</p>
            <p>Passwords with mixed cases are significantly more difficult to crack than those with only one case. This increases overall password security.</p>
            <p>Randomly combining cases within your password can thwart common cracking methods that assume a single case.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>5. Incorporate numbers.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Numbers help to diversify your password and make it more difficult for automated tools to crack it.</p>
            <p>Including numbers in your password can help avoid predictable patterns, adding an extra layer of complexity.</p>
            <p>Try mixing numbers in various positions, rather than using sequential or easily guessable numbers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>6. Regularly update your password every 30-60 days.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Changing your password periodically reduces the risk of long-term exposure in case of a data breach.</p>
            <p>Regular updates ensure that even if a password is compromised, the window of vulnerability is minimized.</p>
            <p>Implement a schedule for changing passwords and follow it consistently to maintain account security.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>7. Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive operations like banking or password changes.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Public Wi-Fi networks can be insecure. Avoid using them for sensitive activities to protect your information from potential theft.</p>
            <p>Hackers can intercept data on public networks, making it risky to perform actions like banking or password changes.</p>
            <p>If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a VPN to encrypt your connection and protect your data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>8. If using unknown devices, consider using incognito mode for added privacy.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Incognito mode can help protect your privacy by not saving browsing history or cookies, reducing the risk of your password being tracked.</p>
            <p>Using incognito mode ensures that your session data is not stored on the device, reducing the risk of exposure if the device is compromised.</p>
            <p>However, note that incognito mode does not make you invisible online; use it in conjunction with other security practices.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>9. Avoid common patterns like sequential numbers or keyboard rows.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Patterns such as "123456" or "qwerty" are easily guessable. Choose passwords that are less predictable and more random.</p>
            <p>Common patterns are frequently tested by attackers, making them a weak choice for passwords.</p>
            <p>Consider using a password generator to create complex, random combinations that avoid easily guessable sequences.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>10. Never store passwords in unnecessary places like notes or chats.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Storing passwords in easily accessible places can lead to them being exposed. Use secure methods for password storage.</p>
            <p>Digital notes or chat messages are not secure storage solutions. Instead, use a dedicated password manager to keep your credentials safe.</p>
            <p>Regularly review your password storage practices to ensure they meet current security standards.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>11. Use a password manager for secure storage and auto-fill.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Password managers securely store and encrypt your passwords, making it easier to manage complex credentials without memorizing them all.</p>
            <p>They can also generate strong passwords and automatically fill in login details, reducing the risk of exposure.</p>
            <p>Choose a reputable password manager with strong security features to ensure your credentials are protected.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>12. Enable two-factor authentication for an extra layer of security.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Two-factor authentication adds an additional verification step, making it harder for attackers to access your accounts.</p>
            <p>Even if your password is compromised, the additional factor provides an extra barrier to unauthorized access.</p>
            <p>Use apps like Google Authenticator or hardware tokens to implement two-factor authentication effectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>13. Be cautious of phishing attempts. Always double-check the authenticity of links and emails.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Phishing attacks often mimic legitimate communications. Verify the source before clicking links or entering sensitive information.</p>
            <p>Check URLs and email addresses carefully to avoid falling victim to phishing scams that could compromise your credentials.</p>
            <p>Be skeptical of unsolicited requests for sensitive information, and use trusted channels for communication.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <span>14. Continually educate yourself on password security best practices.</span>
            <span class="arrow">&#9654;</span>
